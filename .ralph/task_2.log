Perfect! Task #2 (Display Formatting) has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Completed Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **internal/cli/display.go** - Created with all required types and functions:
   - `DisplayConfig` - Controls status output formatting
   - `UnitDisplay` - Represents a unit's display state
   - `TaskDisplay` - Represents a task's display state
   - `StatusSymbol` - Type with constants for status symbols (✓, ●, ○, ✗, →)
   - `RenderProgressBar()` - Renders progress bars with Unicode block characters
   - `GetStatusSymbol()` - Maps task status to appropriate symbols
   - `FormatUnitStatus()` - Formats unit status for display
   - `FormatTaskLine()` - Formats individual task lines

2. **internal/discovery/types.go** - Created with required types referenced by display.go:
   - `Unit`, `UnitStatus`, `Task`, `TaskStatus` types

3. **internal/cli/display_test.go** - Created comprehensive tests:
   - All 7 required tests passing
   - Tests cover empty, half, and full progress bars
   - Tests cover all status symbol mappings

### Validation Results:
- ✓ All tests pass (7/7)
- ✓ `go fmt ./...` passes
- ✓ `go vet ./...` passes
- ✓ Spec frontmatter updated to `status: complete`

The implementation follows the spec exactly, using Unicode block characters (█ and ░) for progress bars and appropriate symbols for task status indicators.
