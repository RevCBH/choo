Excellent! Task #2 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:

## Task Complete

I've successfully implemented the Worktree Management functionality for Ralph as specified in task #2:

### What was implemented:

1. **Created `/internal/git/worktree.go`** with the following types and functions:
   - `WorktreeManager` struct with fields for RepoRoot, WorktreeBase, SetupCommands, and Claude client
   - `Worktree` struct representing an active worktree
   - `ConditionalCommand` struct for conditional setup commands
   - `NewWorktreeManager()` - creates a new worktree manager
   - `CreateWorktree()` - creates worktrees at `.ralph/worktrees/<unitID>/`
   - `RemoveWorktree()` - removes worktrees and their directories
   - `ListWorktrees()` - lists all ralph-managed worktrees
   - `CleanupOrphans()` - removes orphaned worktree references
   - `DefaultSetupCommands()` - returns default setup commands for npm, pnpm, yarn, cargo, and go
   - `runSetupCommands()` - executes conditional setup commands

2. **Created `/internal/git/worktree_test.go`** with comprehensive tests:
   - TestWorktreeManager_Create
   - TestWorktreeManager_CreateBranch
   - TestWorktreeManager_Remove
   - TestWorktreeManager_List
   - TestConditionalCommand_Matching
   - TestConditionalCommand_NoMatch
   - TestDefaultSetupCommands

3. **Updated `/internal/cli/wire.go`** to use the new WorktreeManager signature

### All validations passed:
- ✅ All worktree tests pass
- ✅ `go fmt ./...` - no formatting issues
- ✅ `go vet ./...` - no vet issues
- ✅ Spec frontmatter updated to `status: complete`

### Key implementation details:
- Worktrees are created at `.ralph/worktrees/<unitID>/`
- Branch naming uses simple `ralph/<unitID>` pattern (Task #3 will handle proper branch naming)
- Only the first matching setup command runs
- Setup command failures cause worktree creation to fail
- Handles macOS symlink resolution (`/var` vs `/private/var`)
