Task completed successfully. I have implemented the root command and App struct for the CLI according to the specification:

## Summary

1. **Created** `internal/cli/cli.go` with:
   - `App` struct containing rootCmd, config (as interface placeholder), verbose flag, cancel function, and shutdown channel
   - Version fields (version, commit, date) for the version command
   - `New()` function that creates and initializes the App
   - `Execute()` method that runs the root command
   - `SetVersion()` method to set version information
   - `setupRootCmd()` private method that configures the Cobra root command with:
     - Use: "choo"
     - Short and Long descriptions
     - SilenceUsage: true
     - SilenceErrors: true
     - Persistent verbose flag (-v/--verbose)

2. **Initialized** Go module as `github.com/anthropics/choo`

3. **Added** Cobra dependency v1.8.1 (meets the v1.8+ requirement)

4. **Validated** all requirements:
   - Backpressure command passed: `go build ./internal/cli/...`
   - Baseline checks passed: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`

5. **Updated** task spec frontmatter status from `in_progress` to `complete`

The implementation follows the spec exactly, providing the foundation for all CLI subcommands to be added in subsequent tasks.
