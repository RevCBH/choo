Task completed successfully! Here's what I implemented:

## Summary

I've successfully completed the Event Types task (specs/tasks/events/01-event-types.md). All deliverables have been implemented and validated:

### Files Created/Modified

1. **internal/events/types.go** - Created with:
   - Event struct with all required fields (Time, Type, Unit, Task, PR, Payload, Error)
   - EventType as a string type
   - All event type constants (Orchestrator, Unit, Task, PR, and Git operation events)
   - All required functions (NewEvent, WithTask, WithPR, WithPayload, WithError, IsFailure, String)

2. **internal/events/bus.go** - Modified to remove duplicate Event struct definition

3. **internal/events/types_test.go** - Created comprehensive tests covering all requirements

### Validation Results

✅ **All tests passed** (go test ./internal/events/... -v)
- TestNewEvent
- TestEvent_WithTask
- TestEvent_WithPR
- TestEvent_WithPayload
- TestEvent_WithError
- TestEvent_IsFailure (all failure types)
- TestEvent_IsFailure_Success (all success types)
- TestEvent_String (all formatting cases)

✅ **Baseline checks passed** (go fmt ./... && go vet ./...)

✅ **Spec frontmatter updated** to status: complete

The implementation follows all specifications exactly, with builder methods returning immutable copies, proper nil error handling, and the correct String format matching `[event.type] unit task=#N pr=#M`.
