Perfect! Task #4 (Version Command) has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

Successfully implemented the version command according to the task spec:

### Files Created:
1. `internal/cli/version.go` - Contains `NewVersionCmd` function that creates the version command
2. `internal/cli/version_test.go` - Contains comprehensive tests for the version command

### Files Modified:
1. `internal/cli/cli.go` - Added `VersionInfo` struct, updated `App` struct to use `versionInfo`, updated `SetVersion` method, and added version command to `setupRootCmd`

### Implementation Details:
- Created `VersionInfo` struct with Version, Commit, and Date fields
- Implemented `NewVersionCmd` function that displays version information in the format:
  ```
  choo version X.Y.Z
  commit: abc1234
  built: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
  ```
- Default values are used when version info is not set: "dev" for version, "unknown" for commit and date
- All tests pass (TestVersionCmd_Output, TestVersionCmd_Format, TestSetVersion, TestVersionCmd_DefaultValues)
- Baseline checks (go fmt, go vet) pass
- Spec frontmatter status updated to `complete`
