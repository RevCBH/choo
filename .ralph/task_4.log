Task #4 (Config Validation) has been completed successfully! Here's what was implemented:

## Summary

I created the config validation logic as specified in the task spec:

### Files Created

1. **internal/config/validate.go**
   - `ValidationError` type with structured error details (Field, Value, Message)
   - `validateConfig` function that validates all config fields according to the rules
   - Uses `errors.Join()` to collect and return multiple validation errors

2. **internal/config/validate_test.go**
   - All 19 required test cases covering:
     - Parallelism validation (zero, negative, valid)
     - GitHub owner/repo validation (empty, "auto", valid)
     - Claude command and max_turns validation
     - Merge max_conflict_retries validation
     - Review timeout and poll_interval duration validation
     - LogLevel validation (including case-sensitivity)
     - BaselineCheck validation (name and command)
     - Worktree setup/teardown command validation
     - Multiple errors joined together
     - Valid config with no errors

### Validation Results

- ✅ Backpressure command passed: `go test ./internal/config/... -run TestValidat`
- ✅ Baseline checks passed: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`
- ✅ Spec frontmatter status updated to `complete`

All validation rules from the spec have been implemented correctly, including proper error messages with field names and values.
