Excellent! Task #9 - Component Wiring is now complete. Here's what was implemented:

## Summary

I successfully implemented the component wiring task for the CLI orchestrator. Here's what was delivered:

### Created Files:

1. **internal/cli/wire.go** - Main wiring implementation with:
   - `Orchestrator` struct holding all wired components
   - `WireOrchestrator()` function that assembles components in the correct dependency order
   - `Close()` method for graceful shutdown
   - `loadConfig()` function that loads from .choo.yaml or uses defaults

2. **internal/cli/wire_test.go** - Comprehensive test suite with all required tests:
   - TestWireOrchestrator_AllComponents ✓
   - TestWireOrchestrator_EventBus ✓
   - TestOrchestrator_Close ✓
   - TestLoadConfig_Default ✓
   - TestLoadConfig_FromFile ✓

3. **Stub packages** for dependencies (these will be fully implemented in their respective tasks):
   - internal/config/config.go
   - internal/events/bus.go
   - internal/scheduler/scheduler.go
   - internal/worker/pool.go
   - internal/git/worktree.go
   - internal/github/client.go

4. **Test fixtures**:
   - internal/cli/testdata/wire/.choo.yaml

### Validation Results:

✅ Backpressure command passes: `go test ./internal/cli/... -run Wire`
✅ Baseline checks pass: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`
✅ Spec frontmatter updated to `status: complete`

The implementation follows the wiring diagram from the spec, creating components in the correct dependency order and ensuring the event bus is shared across all components that need it.
