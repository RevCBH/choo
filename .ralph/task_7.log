Excellent! Task #7 (Resume Command) has been successfully implemented. Here's a summary of what was completed:

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the Resume Command task according to the specification:

### Files Created:
1. **internal/cli/resume.go** - Contains:
   - `NewResumeCmd()` - Creates the resume command with inherited run command flags
   - `ResumeOrchestrator()` - Continues orchestration from the last saved state
   - `validateResumeState()` - Validates that state can be resumed

2. **internal/cli/resume_test.go** - Contains all required tests:
   - `TestResumeCmd_InheritsRunFlags` - Verifies resume has same flags as run
   - `TestResumeOrchestrator_NoState` - Tests error when no previous state
   - `TestResumeOrchestrator_AllComplete` - Tests error when all units complete
   - `TestResumeOrchestrator_PartialState` - Tests resuming from incomplete unit
   - `TestValidateResumeState_Valid` - Tests accepting state with incomplete units
   - `TestValidateResumeState_Complete` - Tests rejecting fully complete state
   - Additional tests for corrupted state, nil discovery, and empty units

3. **Test fixtures** in `testdata/resume/`:
   - `partial/` - Partial state with incomplete tasks
   - `complete/` - Fully complete state
   - `empty/` - Empty state with no units

### Files Modified:
1. **internal/cli/cli.go** - Added `NewResumeCmd(a)` to the root command
2. **internal/discovery/types.go** - Added `Discovery` struct with `Units` field
3. **specs/tasks/cli/07-resume-command.md** - Updated status from `in_progress` to `complete`

### Validation:
- All tests pass: `go test ./internal/cli/... -run Resume -v`
- Baseline checks pass: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`
- Task spec frontmatter updated to `status: complete`

The implementation follows the specification exactly, including proper error messages for various edge cases and inheritance of all run command flags.
