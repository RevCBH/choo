Perfect! All six required tests are passing:

1. ✅ `TestCleanupCmd_DefaultFlags` - ResetState defaults to false
2. ✅ `TestCleanupCmd_ResetStateFlag` - --reset-state flag is recognized
3. ✅ `TestCleanup_NoWorktrees` - Handles case with no worktrees gracefully
4. ✅ `TestCleanup_RemovesWorktrees` - Worktrees are removed
5. ✅ `TestCleanup_WithResetState` - Frontmatter reset to pending
6. ✅ `TestResetFrontmatterState` - All tasks set to pending status

All baseline checks also pass (go fmt, go vet), and the spec frontmatter has been updated to `complete`.

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the cleanup command for the Ralph orchestrator according to Task #8 specifications. Here's what was delivered:

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **internal/cli/cleanup.go** - Complete implementation including:
   - `CleanupOptions` struct with TasksDir and ResetState fields
   - `NewCleanupCmd()` function to create the cobra command
   - `Cleanup()` method on App to remove worktrees and optionally reset state
   - `resetFrontmatterState()` function to reset all unit and task frontmatter
   - Helper functions for frontmatter parsing and manipulation

2. **internal/cli/cleanup_test.go** - Comprehensive test coverage with all 6 required tests

3. **internal/cli/cli.go** - Updated to register the cleanup command

4. **go.mod** - Added gopkg.in/yaml.v3 dependency

### Features Implemented:
- Removes all worktrees from `.ralph/worktrees/`
- Optional `--reset-state` flag to reset frontmatter fields to pending
- Idempotent operation (safe to run multiple times)
- Error handling that continues cleanup even if individual operations fail
- Summary output showing what was cleaned
- Resets orchestrator-managed fields: orch_status, orch_branch, orch_pr_number, orch_started_at, orch_completed_at

All validation tests pass, and the task spec has been marked as complete.
