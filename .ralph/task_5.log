Perfect! Task completed successfully. Let me provide a summary:

## Task Complete ✓

I have successfully implemented Task #5: Merge Serialization according to the spec. Here's what was delivered:

### Files Created

1. **`internal/git/merge.go`** - Complete implementation with:
   - `MergeManager` struct with mutex-based serialization
   - `MergeResult` struct for operation outcomes
   - `NewMergeManager` constructor
   - `Merge()` method with mutex-based FCFS locking
   - `ScheduleBranchDelete()` for deferred branch cleanup
   - `FlushDeletes()` to execute pending deletions
   - `Rebase()` with conflict detection
   - `ForcePushWithLease()` for safe force pushes
   - `Fetch()` for fetching target branches
   - `deleteBranch()` for local and remote branch deletion
   - `getConflictedFiles()` for conflict detection
   - `continueRebase()` and `abortRebase()` for rebase control

2. **`internal/git/merge_test.go`** - Comprehensive test coverage with all required tests:
   - `TestMergeManager_Serialization` - Validates concurrent merges execute serially
   - `TestMergeManager_AcquireLock` - Validates mutex blocks concurrent access
   - `TestMergeManager_PendingDeletes` - Validates ScheduleBranchDelete adds to list
   - `TestMergeManager_FlushDeletes` - Validates clearing of pending deletes
   - `TestRebase_NoConflicts` - Returns hasConflicts=false when clean
   - `TestRebase_WithConflicts` - Returns hasConflicts=true on conflicts
   - `TestForcePushWithLease` - Validates force push with lease
   - `TestFetch` - Validates fetching target branch
   - `TestGetConflictedFiles` - Returns list of conflicted file paths
   - `TestDeleteBranch_Local` - Validates local branch deletion
   - `TestDeleteBranch_Remote` - Validates remote branch deletion
   - Additional tests for continueRebase, abortRebase, and NewMergeManager

### Verification Results

✅ All backpressure tests pass: `go test ./internal/git/... -v -run TestMerge`
✅ All baseline checks pass: `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...`
✅ Spec frontmatter updated: `status: in_progress` → `status: complete`

The implementation follows the spec exactly, providing mutex-based FCFS serialization for safe concurrent merge operations with deferred branch deletion.
