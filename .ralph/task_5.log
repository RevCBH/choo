Excellent! Task #5 (PR Comments) is now complete. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Summary

I successfully implemented PR comment fetching functionality as specified in task #5:

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **internal/github/comments.go** - Added:
   - `ghReviewComment` and `ghUser` types for GitHub API response parsing
   - `GetPRComments()` - Fetches all review comments on a PR via GitHub API
   - `GetUnaddressedComments()` - Filters comments created after a given timestamp

2. **internal/github/review.go** - Removed:
   - Stub implementation of `GetPRComments()` (moved to comments.go with full implementation)

3. **internal/github/comments_test.go** - Created with 8 tests:
   - `TestGetPRComments_Empty` - Handles PR with no comments
   - `TestGetPRComments_Multiple` - Parses multiple comments correctly
   - `TestGetPRComments_ParsesPath` - Extracts file path correctly
   - `TestGetPRComments_ParsesLine` - Handles line numbers including null values
   - `TestGetPRComments_ParsesAuthor` - Extracts author login correctly
   - `TestGetUnaddressedComments_FiltersBySince` - Filters by timestamp
   - `TestGetUnaddressedComments_AllNew` - Returns all when all are new
   - `TestGetUnaddressedComments_NoneNew` - Returns empty when none are new

4. **specs/tasks/github/05-comments.md** - Updated:
   - Status changed from `in_progress` to `complete`

### Validation Results:
- All 8 required tests pass
- `go fmt ./...` - passed
- `go vet ./...` - passed

The implementation correctly handles the GitHub API's review comments endpoint, including proper handling of null line numbers for general comments, and integrates with the existing review polling functionality from task #3.
