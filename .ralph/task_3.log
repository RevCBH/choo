## Summary

I've successfully implemented Task #3: Branch Naming via Claude according to the specification.

### Files Created
- `internal/git/branch.go` - Branch naming and validation implementation
- `internal/git/branch_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Branch Type** - Represents a git branch with metadata (Name, UnitID, TargetBranch)

2. **BranchNamer** - Generates creative branch names using Claude:
   - Uses Claude haiku model for memorable 2-3 word suffixes
   - Automatically falls back to random 6-character suffix if Claude fails
   - Default prefix: "ralph/"

3. **ValidateBranchName** - Validates branch names against git rules:
   - No empty names
   - Cannot start with "refs/"
   - Cannot contain ".." or spaces
   - Additional checks for leading hyphens, trailing dots, etc.

4. **SanitizeBranchName** - Converts strings to valid branch name components:
   - Lowercase conversion
   - Replaces spaces, slashes, dots with hyphens
   - Removes special characters
   - Cleans up multiple consecutive hyphens

5. **randomSuffix** - Generates 6-character alphanumeric fallback suffixes

### Test Results
All tests passing:
- ✅ All 13 required tests from the spec
- ✅ Additional comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ `go fmt ./...` - OK
- ✅ `go vet ./...` - OK
- ✅ Backpressure validation: `go test ./internal/git/...` - PASS

### Spec Status
Updated `specs/tasks/git/03-branch.md` frontmatter status from `in_progress` to `complete`.
