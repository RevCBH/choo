Perfect! Task #3 for the events system has been completed successfully. Here's a summary of what was implemented:

## Completed: Built-in Handlers

### Files Created:
1. **internal/events/handlers.go** - Implements `LogHandler` and `StateHandler`
2. **internal/events/handlers_test.go** - Comprehensive test coverage

### Implementation Details:

**LogHandler**:
- Logs events to a configurable writer (defaults to os.Stderr)
- Format: `[event.type] unit task=#N pr=#M`
- Supports optional payload inclusion
- Configurable timestamp format

**StateHandler**:
- Persists unit state changes to frontmatter via the Unit interface
- Maps events to state transitions:
  - `UnitStarted` → status `in_progress`
  - `UnitCompleted` → status `complete`
  - `UnitFailed` → status `failed`
  - `PRCreated` → status `pr_open` + sets PR number
  - `PRReviewInProgress` → status `in_review`
  - `PRMergeQueued` → status `merging`
- Handles errors via optional `OnError` callback
- Gracefully ignores events for unknown units

### Validation Results:
- ✅ All 14 handler tests pass
- ✅ All existing event tests pass (28 total tests)
- ✅ `go fmt` - no formatting issues
- ✅ `go vet` - no issues found
- ✅ Task spec frontmatter updated to `status: complete`

The implementation follows the spec exactly, avoiding circular imports by defining a local Unit interface, and includes all required test cases for LogHandler and StateHandler functionality.
